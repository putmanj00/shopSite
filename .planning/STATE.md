# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** A shopper lands on a beautiful, nature-inspired handmade goods storefront and immediately feels the warmth and authenticity of the Wildenflower brand — while the Shopify integration underneath works reliably.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.2 — Phase 18: Security & Dev Tooling
## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 23 (Security & Dev Tooling) [IN PROGRESS]
Plan: 18-02 complete (2 of 3)
Status: Phase 18 In Progress; Plans 18-01 and 18-02 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Executed Phase 18 Plan 02. gitleaks audit: 198 commits scanned, zero secret findings. .env* confirmed in .gitignore and absent from git history. SEC-02 and SEC-03 satisfied.

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 12% (v1.2)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 roadmap]: Phase 16 starts with legal pages before cookie banner — banner must link to Privacy Policy (hard dependency)
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Playwright tests (Phase 19) precede CI pipeline (Phase 20) — CI E2E job requires test files to exist
- [v1.2 roadmap]: SHOP-01–08 grouped as admin checklist phase (Phase 23) — executed as verification, not code changes
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Phases 16, 18, 19 have no interdependency — can begin in any order; default order is sequential
- [v1.2 roadmap]: OpenTofu local state (gitignored) acceptable for solo dev two-project setup; no Terraform Cloud needed
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Sentry gated to NODE_ENV === 'production' — avoids burning 5k/month free tier quota in dev
- [18-01]: CSP deployed in Report-Only mode — flip CSP_ENFORCE=true in next.config.ts after confirming zero violations in production
- [18-01]: X-Frame-Options DENY (not SAMEORIGIN) — no framing use case for this storefront
- [18-01]: HSTS 2yr with preload directive — ready for HSTS preload list submission
- [18-02]: gitleaks installed via GitHub release binary (not brew) — brew was compiling Go from source on macOS 13
- [18-02]: Git history confirmed clean — no credential rotation required; history rewrite policy moot

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OAuth auth routes (app/api/auth/customer/) are fragile — no logic changes in v1.2
- CSP header whitelists `*.shopify.com` and `checkout.shopify.com` — implemented in 18-01 (connect-src and form-action)
- Vercel dev project URL must be added to Shopify Customer Account API allowed redirect URIs when Phase 21 runs
- Playwright cannot test Shopify checkout completion (cross-domain, anti-bot) — test order via bogus gateway in Phase 23 instead
